## Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

<ul>
  <li>Developed a classification model to predict heart disease using feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques.</li>
  <li>Preprocessed features such as 'thalach' (maximum heart rate achieved) and 'oldpeak' (ST depression induced by exercise) by binning into categorical ranges.</li>
  <li>Transformed numerical features into meaningful categories for improved model interpretability and performance.</li>
  <li>Used Python libraries including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.</li>
  <li>Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations with target variable.</li>
  <li>Cleaned and prepared data for training classification models, possibly for use in frameworks like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or XGBoost.</li>
  <li>Mounted Google Drive in Colab environment to access datasets and store output files, ensuring seamless integration and reproducibility.</li>
